# WWT_Hackathon
Defending Truth in a Digital World.


# About the Project
Our deepfake detection project was inspired by the increasing prevalence of manipulated media and its potential to erode trust in digital content. Recognizing the urgent need to address this challenge, we set out to develop a solution that could accurately identify deepfakes and help organizations protect their integrity and reputation.

Throughout the project, we learned a great deal about the complexities of deepfake technology and the importance of robust model validation. Building the project involved selecting and preprocessing a suitable dataset, designing a convolutional neural network model, and fine-tuning it for optimal performance. We explored different approaches, including transfer learning, to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency.

One of the main challenges we faced was balancing the model's sensitivity to false positives and false negatives, ensuring it was both reliable and practical for real-world use. We also had to navigate the technical hurdles of processing video data and managing large datasets.

Ultimately, this project taught us the importance of continuous learning and iteration in AI development, as well as the critical role of ethical considerations in deploying such powerful technology.
